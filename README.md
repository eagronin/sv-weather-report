# Results

This section discusses the results of the analysis of weather patterns in Silicon Valley performed in the previous section.  The figure below shows that the range of temperatures in Silicon Valley has widened in 2015 as compared to the previous 10-year period (from 2005 to 2014).  In particular, the record high temperature has been broken on numerous days during 2015.

The analysis is described in the [previous section](https://eagronin.github.io/sv-weather-analyze).

This project is based on assignments from Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python by University of Michigan on Coursera

The analysis for this project was performed in Python.

While the pattern is suggestive of global warming, further analysis needs to be conducted to confirm the significance of this pattern.  First, a longer period should be analyzed for the purpose of creating the range of low and high temperatures.  Second, 2015 could be simply an anomalous year.  Therefore, it is important to check if such a pattern can be replicated for other years.  Thirdly, a test should be conducted whether the number of record-breaking days in 2015 is statistically significantly higher than the number of record-breaking days expected to occur in any particular year.
